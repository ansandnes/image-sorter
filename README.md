# image-sorter

I have plenty of images on my hard drive that I have taken over the years. All of these images are stored in the same place. This project aims to sort images by the time and location where the picture was taken. Corresponding folders will be created, and the photos will be reorganized.

If you clone this repo, edit the image_dir variable in image_dir_path here:
