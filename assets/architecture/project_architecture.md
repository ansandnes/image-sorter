# Project Architecture

The project architecture is designed to be modular and extensible. The main components of the project are:

* **Image Organizer**: This component is responsible for organizing the images based on their metadata. It uses the **Image Metadata** component to extract the metadata from the images and then uses the **Geocoder Service** component to get the location from the GPS coordinates.
* **Image Metadata**: This component is responsible for extracting the metadata from the images. It uses the **piexif** library to extract the EXIF data from the images.
* **Geocoder Service**: This component is responsible for getting the location from the GPS coordinates. It uses the **geopy** library to get the location from the GPS coordinates.

Python was chosen as the backend language for this project because of its simplicity, ease of use, and extensive libraries. The **piexif** library makes it easy to extract the EXIF data from the images, and the **geopy** library makes it easy to get the location from the GPS coordinates.

Other frameworks that would work well for this project include:

* **Node.js**: Node.js is a popular choice for building backend applications. It has a large ecosystem of libraries and is well suited for building real-time applications.
* **Go**: Go is a statically typed language that is designed for building scalable and concurrent systems. It has a growing ecosystem of libraries and is well suited for building backend applications.
* **Rust**: Rust is a systems programming language that is designed for building fast and reliable applications. It has a growing ecosystem of libraries and is well suited for building backend applications.
